This repository utilizes API routes in a NoSQL environment to create a social networking project that displays user data and any associated 
friends, thoughts or reactions they may have.
Using Insomnia, this data can all be viewed by accessing the according API routes as they are defined. The repository takes advantage of Express.js 
and Mongoose while obtaining its data through MongoDB.

Data in Insomnia can follow the CRUD principle where data can be created, read, updated and deleted in order to reflect the data as it is being updated.
Node.js is also used to create the routes, models and connect to the server.

A link to the video that starts up the server can be accessed here. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wDNaLLnJnbHkRVhmZCbsl3W716Tj2ngf/view
